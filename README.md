I have four files uploaded to this repository:

JupyterSharkAttackModel_TD.ipynb which is the python notebook with all the work for this project
JupyterSharkAttackModel_TD.pdf which is simply a pdf version of this notebook 
WhitePaper_ModelingSharkAttacks.docx which is a white paper written on this subject
ModelingSharkAttackOccurence.pptx which is a powerpoint slide deck that was used in the video presentation 

Please feel free to reach out if there are any issues accessing or you have any questions on code, approach, etc.
