I have four files uploaded to this repository:

JupyterSharkAttackModel_TD.ipynb which is the python notebook with all the work for this project, JupyterSharkAttackModel_TD.pdf which is simply a pdf version of this notebook , WhitePaper_ModelingSharkAttacks.docx which is a white paper written on this subject, ModelingSharkAttackOccurence.pptx which is a powerpoint slide deck that was used in the video presentation. **Please note** I do not have the original excel data files in this respository, as some of the data I am working with is restricted-use only due to certain policies from the data-originators. That said, the python notebooks have the output of all the code executed, so they should show all the results of the analysis of this data.  Please feel free to reach out if there are any issues accessing or you have any questions on code, approach, etc.
